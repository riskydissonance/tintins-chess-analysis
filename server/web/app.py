# Force a JavaScript MIME type for .js/.mjs regardless of the host's mimetypes registry. The board
# loads `main.js` as an ES module (`<script type="module">`) and that module imports the vendored
# chessground/chess.js from `/vendor/*.min.js`; browsers REFUSE a module script unless it's served
# with a JS MIME. On Windows, `mimetypes.guess_type` reads the registry, where some installed apps
# map `.js` -> `text/plain`, which would break the offline board ("Failed to load module script").
# `add_type` runs init() first then overrides, so our value wins over any registry entry.

# --- Local-only request guard (CSRF / DNS-rebinding defence) ------------------------------------
# The board binds to loopback, but loopback is NOT a security boundary for a *browser*: any website
# the user visits can make their browser send requests to 127.0.0.1, and a DNS-rebinding attack can
# even turn that into a same-origin read. Our endpoints spawn `claude -p` (burns the user's Claude
# quota) and expose game history + the Lichess token, so we reject requests that don't originate
# from the board itself. Two checks, both standard for localhost apps:
#   * Host header must be a loopback name — defeats DNS rebinding (the browser sends the attacker's
#     hostname in Host even after the IP rebinds to 127.0.0.1).
#   * Origin header (when present) must be loopback — blocks ordinary cross-site fetch/POST.
# "testserver" is allowed so Starlette's TestClient works; a real browser can't be coerced into
# sending that Host while connecting to the user's machine, so it doesn't widen the attack surface.
