"""History + game-import + background-analysis routes for the web board.

Powers the board's third column: list previously-analysed local games (`/api/history`), browse a
Lichess user's recent games (`/api/lichess/games`), and reopen any of them by kicking off a
background analysis (`/api/analyze` + `/api/analysis-status`). Sync `def` handlers like
routes_board — they're light (history is a file read; lichess is a short HTTP call; analyze just
spawns a thread).
