"""Settings routes: read/update the user-editable config so the app is standalone.

`GET /api/settings` returns the current effective values for the Settings panel; `POST /api/settings`
persists a patch to `<DATA_DIR>/settings.json`, applies it to the live `config`, and handles the one
change with a side effect — a new Stockfish path, which is validated then triggers an engine restart.
