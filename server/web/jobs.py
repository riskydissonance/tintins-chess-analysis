"""Background full-game analysis for the web board.

The board lets a user reopen a past game (local history) or a fetched Lichess game. Analysis is
the slow part (~20-45s engine sweep), so we run it in a daemon thread and expose a tiny status
machine the frontend polls — meanwhile the board navigates the moves from a client-side PGN replay
(see frontend `openGame`). When the job finishes it populates the SAME singleton `ReviewSession`
the MCP tools use, so `/api/session` and `/api/timeline` then serve the real analysis.

Single-user, single-engine-pool tool ⇒ at most one analysis at a time. A monotonically increasing
`token` gives superseding semantics: if a newer open arrives, the older thread's result is dropped
rather than clobbering the session. Mirrors `mcp_server.analyze_game` (set_session + record_game),
minus the browser-open (the board is already open).
