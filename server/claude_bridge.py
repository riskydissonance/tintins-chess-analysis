"""Bridge to headless Claude Code for the in-browser chat (Phase 6).

Shells out to `claude -p` so the browser's "why?" questions are answered on the user's
Claude subscription (the separate Agent SDK credit), NOT the per-token API. We pass the
chess MCP config + pre-approve the chess tools so Claude grounds its answer in real engine
lines via `get_engine_line`.

Note: `claude -p --mcp-config` spawns its own (separate) chess MCP server process with an
empty session — that's fine, because chat is grounded on the FEN/move passed in the prompt
through the stateless `get_engine_line` tool. We pass CHESS_WEB_AUTOSTART=0 to that child so
it doesn't try to bind the board port we're already serving on.
