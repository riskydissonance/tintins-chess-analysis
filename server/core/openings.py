"""Local ECO/opening name lookup, so games whose PGN lacks Opening/ECO headers still get
named (e.g. Chess.com exports — Lichess ships the names, Chess.com bulk exports often don't).

Engine-free and deterministic, like the motif heuristics in `history.py`. We vendor the
Lichess `chess-openings` dataset (`server/data/eco/{a..e}.tsv`, ~3.7k named lines) and key it
by board EPD (FEN minus the move/halfmove counters) so transpositions collapse to the same
position. Classification walks a game's positions in play order and keeps the DEEPEST match —
the most specific named line the game actually reached. Same dataset Lichess uses, so names
match what you'd see there.
