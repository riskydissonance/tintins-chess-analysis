"""Turn a player's OWN mistakes into puzzles — a "learn from your blunders" trainer.

Every analysed game already stores, per flagged mistake, the position it was played from
(`fen_before`), the move actually played (`uci`), the engine's best reply (`best_uci`/`best_san`),
the tactical motif tags (`motifs`), and how much win chance it cost (`win_drop`) — see
`history.build_game_record`. That's exactly a single-best-move puzzle: sit the solver in the
position they went wrong in and ask them to find the move they missed.

So puzzles are pure re-use of existing analysis — no engine calls — which keeps this off the
engine pool entirely. Two entry points:

  - build_puzzles(...)  -> list[Puzzle dicts], hardest-lesson-first, filterable by theme/kind
  - themes(...)         -> per-motif counts (labelled) for "train your weaknesses" chips

Both draw from the SAME set of games as the Insights panel (`history.my_records`), so a weakness
the Insights panel names always has puzzles behind it.
