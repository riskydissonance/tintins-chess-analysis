"""Export a batch of puzzles (from `puzzles.build_puzzles`) into a Lichess study.

Lichess has no API to create user PUZZLES (those are generated centrally from master games), but
it does let you create a STUDY and import chapters via the API. So the trainer's positions become
study chapters instead — and with `mode=practice` each chapter is an interactive "find the moves"
drill on Lichess itself, which is as close to a personal puzzle set as the platform allows.

Two write calls (both need a token with the `study:write` scope):
  - POST /api/study                     -> create the study, returns {"id": ...}
  - POST /api/study/{id}/import-pgn     -> add up to 64 chapters from a multi-game PGN

Each puzzle becomes one chapter whose mainline IS the solution move (so practice mode asks the
solver to find it), with the move actually played attached as an annotated `??` sideline. Chapters
are imported grouped by side-to-move, because import-pgn sets one board orientation for the whole
batch and we want the solver oriented as the side that has to move.
