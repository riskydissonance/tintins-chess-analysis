"""App-mode liveness: quit the server shortly after the app's browser tab is *really* closed.

Only active in **app mode** (CHESS_APP_MODE=1 — the double-click launcher), so the MCP-driven board
never self-exits when you close a tab.

The hard part is telling "tab closed" apart from "tab lost focus / went to the background", because
browsers heavily throttle background-tab timers (down to ~once a minute). So we use two signals:

  - An explicit **close beacon**: the page fires `navigator.sendBeacon('/api/closing')` on `pagehide`
    (tab close / navigation / refresh). After `CLOSE_GRACE` seconds with no new heartbeat we exit —
    fast. A *refresh* also fires `pagehide`, but the reloaded page sends a heartbeat within ~1s,
    which cancels the pending close, so a refresh doesn't kill the server.
  - A slow **heartbeat backstop**: the page POSTs `/api/ping` periodically; if none arrives for
    `BEAT_TIMEOUT` (generous — minutes — so background throttling never trips it) we exit anyway,
    covering the rare case where `pagehide` never fires (e.g. the browser is killed).

Exit mirrors lifecycle.py: `os._exit` after `engine.shutdown()`.
