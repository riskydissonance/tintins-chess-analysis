"""Regression tests for the static frontend mount.

A wheel install (`uv run` for the MCP server) installs only the `server` package; the frontend
used to live as a repo-root sibling of `server/`, so it was NOT shipped in the wheel and the board
served the API but 404'd at `/` ({"detail":"Not Found"}). pyproject force-includes it as
`server/_frontend/` and `app._resolve_frontend_dir` finds it there (or in the source tree). These
tests guard both halves: the resolver locates a real directory, and `/` actually serves the UI.
