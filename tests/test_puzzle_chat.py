"""Tests for puzzle-context AI chat: ChatBody.puzzle, _compose_prompt spoiler rule, and the
puzzle-keyed chat_store transcript separation.

No network / subprocess calls happen here: we call `_compose_prompt` directly and exercise
`chat_store`'s in-memory dict, never `claude_bridge.ask`'s CLI-shelling path.
