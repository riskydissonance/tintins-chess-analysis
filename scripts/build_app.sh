# This is "Option A": a thin wrapper bundle. The .app embeds a read-only copy of the project
# under Contents/Resources/repo and ships a launcher that, on first run, installs uv + Stockfish
# (idempotent), builds the Python environment in a WRITABLE support dir (so the bundle itself
# stays immutable), then serves the board in app mode. Closing the browser tab quits it
# (app-liveness watchdog), exactly like the .command launcher.
#
# Not self-contained like a PyInstaller build: it still needs the network on first run to fetch
# uv + Python + Stockfish, and the in-browser chat still needs the user's own `claude` CLI.
