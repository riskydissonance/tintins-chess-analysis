"""Download the official static Stockfish from GitHub into the app's managed engine path.

The cross-platform fallback used by ``install.sh`` / ``install.ps1`` (and re-usable anywhere) when
there's no system Stockfish and no working package manager — the same idea as the macOS ``.app``
launcher's ``download_stockfish`` (``scripts/build_app.sh``), but for Windows and Linux too. It
needs **no package manager, no sudo, and no PATH changes**: the binary lands at
``config._managed_stockfish_path()`` (``<DATA_DIR>/engine/stockfish[.exe]``), which the app
auto-detects via ``config._resolve_stockfish``.

Stdlib-only (urllib / tarfile / zipfile), so it can run with any Python. Picks the build for this
OS + CPU, downloads, extracts just the engine binary, verifies it actually speaks UCI (an
over-aggressive CPU variant would crash), and falls back to a more compatible build if not. On
success it prints the resolved engine path to stdout and exits 0 (also a no-op success when a system
engine already exists); on failure it prints a hint to stderr and exits 1.
